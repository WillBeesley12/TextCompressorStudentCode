| December 2 |  2:15-3pm   | I spent the rest of class time after the quiz trying to think about how to approach this problem. I was thinking about looking for the repeated words/character sequences, but I do think that this will be too slow and somewhat unreliable as it depends heavily on the specific text I'm given. I started thinking more about algorithms that would compress the files with similar ratios no matter the size if we ignore the metadata, and I did this because I saw alice was 41% and shakespeare was 37%, which are very similar even with different sizes. |

I am trying to come up with a solution that will work no matter the data set, so even if every single word is unique. That would allow me to have a strong compression ratio just like for the last two compression psets. But, I dont think that text has those same properties that I can exploit, so I will most likely look for repeating phrases instead. |

I was having a hard time because I still didnt think this is the right solution but it was all I could think of.  |
